# jAmp Convolve - User Manual

## Overview

**jAmp Convolve** is a professional audio convolution plugin (AUv3) for iOS and macOS. It uses neural network-powered impulse response generation to create realistic guitar cabinet simulations, bass cabinet simulations, and reverb effects. 

## System Requirements

- **iOS**: iOS 14.0 or later
- **macOS**: macOS 11.0 or later (via Mac Catalyst)
- Compatible with any AUv3 host application (GarageBand, Logic Pro, AUM, Cubasis, etc.)

---

## Getting Started

### Standalone App

1. Launch **jAmp Convolve** from your home screen
2. The app will initialize with the microphone for live processing
3. Use the **Mute button** (speaker icon in bottom-left corner) to mute/unmute audio input - this helps avoid feedback when starting up

### As an AUv3 Plugin

1. Open your favorite DAW or AUv3 host
2. Add **jAmp Convolve** as an audio effect on your track
3. The plugin interface will appear with all controls

---

## Interface Overview

The interface adapts to your device orientation:

- **Portrait Mode**: Controls are arranged vertically with the visualization at the bottom
- **Landscape Mode**: Visualization appears on the left, controls on the right

## Main Controls

### Mode Selector (Segmented Control)

Located at the top of the control section, choose between three convolution modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Guitar** | Guitar cabinet impulse responses - ideal for electric guitar amp simulation |
| **Bass** | Bass cabinet impulse responses - designed for bass guitar and low-frequency content |
| **Reverb** | Reverb impulse responses - includes halls, plates, rooms, chambers, ambiences, and spaces |

### Knobs

Five rotary knobs control the main parameters:

| Knob | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Gain** | -18 dB to +18 dB | Output level adjustment |
| **LPF** (Low Pass Filter) | 6 kHz to 22 kHz | Cuts high frequencies - lower values create darker tones |
| **HPF** (High Pass Filter) | 10 Hz to 400 Hz | Cuts low frequencies - higher values reduce bass/rumble |
| **Wet** | 0 to 1 | Level of the processed (convolved) signal |
| **Dry** | 0 to 1 | Level of the original unprocessed signal |

**Tip**: For guitar/bass cabinets, typically use Wet=1 and Dry=0. For reverb, blend both to taste.

### XY Pad (UVST Pad)

The large touch pad controls four parameters simultaneously using two indicators:

| Indicator | Color | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Cyan | U (horizontal), V (vertical) | Primary tonal character |
| **Secondary** | Magenta | S (horizontal), T (vertical) | Secondary tonal shaping |

**How to use**:
- Touch and drag the **cyan indicator** to adjust U and V parameters
- Touch and drag the **magenta indicator** to adjust S and T parameters
- These parameters morph between different impulse response characteristics generated by the neural network

---

## Visualization

Toggle between two visualization modes using the buttons in the top-right corner of the visualization area:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Frequencies** | Displays the frequency response of the current impulse response as a waveform |
| **Spectrogram** | Shows a real-time spectrogram of the audio output |

---

## Presets

### Accessing Presets

Tap the **PRESETS** button to open the presets panel. Use the **‚óÄ** and **‚ñ∂** buttons to quickly navigate to the previous or next preset.

### Preset Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Factory Presets** | Built-in presets organized by category (Guitar, Bass, Reverb halls, plates, rooms, etc.) |
| **User Presets** | Your saved custom presets |

### Preset Categories (Reverb)

Factory reverb presets are organized into banks:

- **A) Guitar** - Guitar cabinet simulations
- **B) Bass** - Bass cabinet simulations  
- **C) Reverb** - Reverb presets

### Managing Presets

| Action | How To |
|--------|--------|
| **Select a preset** | Tap on any preset in the list |
| **Save new preset** | Tap **SAVE AS NEW** and enter a name |
| **Update existing preset** | Select a user preset, tap **OVERWRITE** |
| **Delete preset** | Select a user preset, tap **DELETE** |
| **Delete multiple presets** | Tap **DELETE MANY** and select presets to remove |
| **Import presets** | Tap **IMPORT** to load presets from files |
| **Export presets** | Tap **EXPORT** to share your user presets |

### Organizing User Presets

When saving a preset, you can organize it into banks:
- Select an existing bank or create a new one
- Bank names appear before the preset name (e.g., "My Bank: My Preset")

---

## Mute Button

The **mute button** (speaker icon) is located in the bottom-left corner of the standalone app:

**Tip**: Start with audio muted to avoid feedback when the microphone initializes, then unmute when ready.

---

## Licensing

### Demo Mode

When first launched, the app runs in demo mode:
- Full functionality is available
- Audio will periodically mute for 3 seconds every 57 seconds
- Purchase to remove this limitation

### Purchasing

1. A license prompt will appear on first launch
2. Tap **PURCHASE** to buy the full version
3. Tap **RESTORE PURCHASE** if you've already purchased on another device
4. Tap **CONTINUE DEMO** to continue using the demo version

### Using with the Host App

When the plugin is loaded within the jAmp Convolve standalone app (as the host), the license is automatically validated and demo limitations are removed.

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Guitar/Bass

1. Set mode to **Guitar** or **Bass**
2. Set **Wet** to 1 and **Dry** to 0 for full cabinet simulation
3. Use the **XY Pad** to explore different cabinet characteristics
4. Adjust **LPF** to tame harsh high frequencies
5. Adjust **HPF** to reduce unwanted low-end rumble

### For Reverb

1. Set mode to **Reverb**
2. Balance **Wet** and **Dry** to taste (e.g., Wet=0.3, Dry=1.0 for subtle reverb)
3. Use the **XY Pad** to morph between reverb characteristics
4. Use **LPF** to create darker, more distant reverbs
5. Use **HPF** to prevent low-frequency buildup
